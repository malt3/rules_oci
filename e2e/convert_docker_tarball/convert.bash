# Most rules_oci users will use oci_pull to fetch base layers from a remote registry.
# However, you might build docker-format tarballs and uploaded them to Artifactory for example.
# rules_oci expects an OCI format base image, so these need to be converted.
#
# This just requires push'ing the tarball into a locally-running registry which
# understands both formats, then pull'ing back out in the oci format.
#
# Note, this is suboptimal because Bazel will still have to execute an action that has the entire
# base image as an input. Large inputs cause network delays with remote execution.
